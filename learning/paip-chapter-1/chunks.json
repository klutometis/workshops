More important than the notation is the rule for evaluation.\nIn Lisp, lists are evaluated by first evaluating all the arguments, then applying the function to the arguments, thereby computing the result.\nThis rule is much simpler than the rule for evaluating normal mathematical expressions, where there are many conventions to remember, such as doing multiplications and divisions before sums and differences.\nWe will see below that the actual Lisp evaluation rule is a little more complicated, but not much.\n\nSometimes programmers who are familiar with other languages have preconceptions that make it difficult for them to learn Lisp.\nFor them, three points are worth stressing here.\nFirst, many other languages make a distinction between statements and expressions.\nAn expression, like `2 + 2`, has a value, but a statement, like `x = 2 + 2`, does not.\nStatements have effects, but they do not return values.\nIn Lisp, there is no such distinction: every expression returns a value.\nIt is true that some expressions have effects, but even those expressions also return values.",
