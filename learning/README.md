# Pedagogical Concept Graph: Interactive Learning System

An intelligent learning platform that transforms textbooks into interactive, guided learning experiences using concept graphs, Socratic dialogue, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## Overview

This project demonstrates an AI-powered approach to learning from technical textbooks. Using Peter Norvig's "Paradigms of AI Programming" (PAIP) Chapter 1 as a reference implementation, it creates a structured, interactive learning environment that adapts to each learner's progress.

## Key Features

### 1. **Pedagogical Concept Graph Extraction**

The system analyzes textbook content to automatically extract:
- **Concepts**: Fundamental ideas and skills (e.g., "Recursion", "Symbols", "Quote")
- **Prerequisites**: Directed acyclic graph (DAG) of concept dependencies
- **Learning Objectives**: What students should be able to DO after mastering each concept
- **Mastery Indicators**: Specific, testable skills with difficulty levels (basic/intermediate/advanced)
- **Examples**: Code and explanations demonstrating concepts
- **Misconceptions**: Common student errors and correction strategies
- **Exercise Mappings**: Links textbook exercises to concepts they assess

**Output**: `paip-chapter-1/concept-graph.json` - A structured knowledge graph ready for interactive learning

### 2. **Interactive Graph Visualization**

Built with Next.js and Cytoscape.js, the frontend provides:
- **Visual Concept Map**: All 33 concepts displayed as an interactive graph
- **Topological Sorting**: Prerequisites automatically arranged in learning order
- **Multiple Layouts**: Dagre (hierarchical), breadthfirst, force-directed, and more
- **Smart Navigation**: 
  - Hover to preview prerequisite chains
  - Click to explore concepts in detail
  - Clickable prerequisite badges for fluid navigation
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual states for mastered/ready/locked concepts
- **Recommended Next**: System highlights optimal learning paths

**Technology**: React 19, TypeScript, Cytoscape.js, Tailwind CSS

### 3. **Socratic Dialogue System**

Each concept comes with an AI tutor that:
- **Asks Probing Questions**: Tests understanding through Socratic dialogue, not lecturing
- **Adapts to Responses**: Provides scaffolding when students struggle
- **Tracks Mastery**: Monitors which skills have been demonstrated
- **Grants Progression**: Unlocks dependent concepts only when mastery is achieved
- **Detects Misconceptions**: Uses pedagogical data to identify and correct errors

For programming concepts, learners get an **integrated Python workspace** with real-time code execution:

![Socratic Dialogue with Python Workspace](docs/screenshots/socratic-dialog-euclidian.png)
*AI tutor guides learning while student experiments with live code - clean separation between dialogue and workspace*

**Key Features:**
- **Live Python Execution**: Run code with Pyodide (no backend needed!)
- **Ephemeral Starter Code**: Helpful hints that disappear when you start typing
- **Context-Aware Tutoring**: Your code and output are visible to the AI
- **Clean UX**: Code stays in workspace, avoiding chat clutter
- **Fast Feedback Loop**: Ctrl+Enter to run, instant results

**Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash with structured JSON output for mastery assessment

### 4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

To keep dialogue grounded in the actual textbook:
- **Semantic Chunking**: 92 chunks extracted from PAIP Chapter 1
- **Vector Embeddings**: 3072-dimensional embeddings using `gemini-embedding-001`
- **Cosine Similarity Search**: Finds most relevant textbook passages per concept
- **Client-Side Caching**: Only 1 embedding API call per dialogue session
- **Performance**: ~40% faster on subsequent turns, minimal API costs

**Result**: LLM uses Norvig's actual examples, terminology, and pedagogical approach

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Google API Key with access to Gemini API

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   cd learning
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Technical Highlights

### Multi-Pass Concept Graph Extraction

The concept graph is built through three complementary passes:
1. **Pass 1 (Structure)**: Extract graph topology and basic concept info
2. **Pass 2 (Pedagogy)**: Design learning objectives and mastery indicators
3. **Pass 3 (Exercises)**: Map textbook exercises to concepts

### Semantic Search Pipeline

```typescript
// First turn: Perform semantic search
1. Embed concept name ‚Üí 3072-dim vector
2. Compute cosine similarity across 92 chunks
3. Return top 5 most relevant passages
4. Cache on client-side

// Subsequent turns: Reuse cache
‚Üí No additional embedding API calls!
```

### Structured Mastery Assessment

The LLM returns both dialogue and evaluation in structured JSON:
```json
{
  "message": "Excellent! You understand quote syntax...",
  "mastery_assessment": {
    "indicators_demonstrated": ["quote_syntax", "evaluation_blocking"],
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "ready_for_mastery": false,
    "next_focus": "when_to_quote"
  }
}
```

## Development Scripts

```bash
# Generate semantic chunks from textbook
npx ts-node scripts/chunk-paip.ts paip-chapter-1.md paip-chapter-1/chunks.json

# Generate vector embeddings
npx ts-node scripts/embed-chunks.ts paip-chapter-1/chunks.json paip-chapter-1/embeddings.json

# Merge PCG source files (Pass 1 + Pass 2 + Pass 3)
./merge_pcg.py
```
